Following [Brandon Richeyâ€™s Elm Tutorial](https://medium.com/p/11d7a53b1a78) to build this. Unfortunately, it seems the tutorial is based on pre-Elm 0.17 which uses Signals (now depricated). Made a small effort to update the code to use the newer Subscriptions in Elm, but was unable to complete it in the time allotted.
