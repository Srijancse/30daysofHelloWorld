# Plug-in architecture with Architect
An example of a plug-in, dependency injection architecture. This serves as a basis of what could be a nice, large platform for an app with core modules, as well as configurable "enabled" plug-ins.

Still could use:
- Ability to add/extend routes through plugins
- Better way of handling global core modules, e.g., core/views
