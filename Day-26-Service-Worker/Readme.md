# Service worker + Google Maps Example
Service worker site implementation that stores basic site files for offline use as well as stores all requests to the google maps API, all images requested when panning or zooming, etc.

After visiting the site once, all areas of the map that were previously viewed will be available offline in browsers with support for ServiceWorker and Cache.
