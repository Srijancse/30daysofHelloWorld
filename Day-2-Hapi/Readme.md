# Hapi.js experiment app
A simple web server with one route, `"/"`, which accepts both `GET` and `POST` methods.

The mock "hapi term" app is a simple example that uses a form to `POST` to the root handler. The form passes it's data to a Handlebars template and `push`es entered "command" to the message log.

There are no "real" command line functions.

Uses:
- Handlebars
- Inert
- Vision
