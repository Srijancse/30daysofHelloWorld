# 30 days of hello, world's
30 new things in 30 days to inspire a lasting curiosity & desire to experiment.

I believe the best way to improve, become well rounded, form better opinions, and enhance one's ability to choose the right tool for the occasion is through experience. 30 days of "Hello, world!" challenges one's self to dive into unfamiliar territory with an open mind and zero bias.

In 30 days, I'm challenging myself to experiment with different frameworks, language, libraries, patterns, API's and technology that are unfamiliar or new to me. The goal is simply to gain a better understanding of the tools of the web and tech landscape by getting hands on experience and having fun doing so.
