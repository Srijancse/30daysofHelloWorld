### `#30xHelloworlds`
# 30 days of hello, world's
30 new things in 30 days to inspire a lasting curiosity & desire to experiment.

I believe the best way to improve, become well rounded, form better opinions, and enhance one's ability to choose the right tool for the occasion is through experience. 30 days of "Hello, world!" challenges one's self to dive into unfamiliar territory with an open mind and zero bias.

In 30 days, I'm challenging myself to experiment with different frameworks, language, libraries, patterns, API's and technology that are unfamiliar or new to me. The goal is simply to gain a better understanding of the tools of the web and tech landscape by getting hands on experience and having fun doing so.

# Day 1: ready, set, GO lang.
to get `go`-ing, I chose to start with Go because I figured, if things go well, I could use it throughout the next 30 days as a platform on hosts like Heroku or Google App Engine.

## What I like after 1 day
The syntax seemed quickly familiar with the added difference/bonus of Type Declarations. However, the type interpolation is pretty nice in Go.

Importing dependencies is straight forward and clean.

## Learning curves:
Getting setup with the `$GOPATH` with ZSH for me took a bit of Googling and diving in to Stack Overflow. After adding it to my `.zshrc` everything was fine.

The `struct` way of handling objects, and the lack of traditional classes, is a bit of a mind bend and takes time to understand, after only one day of Go, I haven't quite grasped it, yet.
